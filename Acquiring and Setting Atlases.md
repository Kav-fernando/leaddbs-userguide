## Acquiring and Installing Atlases

The toolbox comes pre-installed with three different atlas sets, namely the ATAG linear, ATAG nonlinear and the ATAG STN atlases. However, depending on the needs of your study, other subcortical atlases may be installed for the use in the toolbox. Atlases that are available in standard nifti format (.nii or .img/.hdr extensions) can principally be used with LEAD DBS but should be available in standard MNI space.

On [this page](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?page_id=45) you can find information about how and where to obtain other subcortical atlases suitable for 2D/3D-visualization using _Lead-DBS_. If an atlas you know of is missing on this page, please contact us so we can add it to our list. If possible, we are also interested in distributing other subcortical atlases alongside the toolbox if they are made available for distribution.
