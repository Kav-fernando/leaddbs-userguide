# Installing an atlas from a repository

In this example, we will use install the `Melbourne subcortex atlas` using code. The complete code is installed in leaddbs/support\_scripts/ but is explained in step-by-step sections below.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
