# Overview

The app Lead-DBS is the main application of the Lead suite. It allows the reconstruction of electrodes for one patient, or a batch of patients, if multiple folders are selected. To start, run `lead dbs`from the Matlab command prompt. \(Make sure to [add the Lead-DBS folder to your Path](../installation-1/installation/setting-a-path-for-_lead-dbs_-in-matlab.md).\) The window below will pop up.

We explain steps 1 through 7 in more detail below. In brief:

1. The user selects the patient folder and electrode type. 
2. Patient images can be converted from DICOM to NIfTI and renamed interactively to fit the Lead-DBS naming convention \(Question: add a page on this?\). 
3. The patient images are co-registered and if selected, normalized into MNI template space and corrected for brain shift. The user can check the results and manually refine the atlas fit. 
4. \(optional\) The surface is reconstructed. 
5. \(optional\) The electrode trajectories are pre-reconstructed. The user can choose between different methods, depending on the postoperative imaging modality. For instance, for postoperative CT, PaCER is an effective method. Afterwards, the user localizes the electrodes to refine the position and --- if applicable --- the orientation of the electrodes.
6. \(optional\) The user can run connectivity analysis with Lead Connectome.
7. The reconstructed electrodes can be visualized in 2D or 3D in template or patient space. The user can select from a comprehensive list of atlases.

The user selects an item to check or uncheck it and then starts the computation of the selected items with `Run`in the bottom right corner.
