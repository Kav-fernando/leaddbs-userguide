# 2. Image Import

You can start by selecting the patient folder containing the DICOM images and run the **Import** function. To further process data, images must be in the `*.nii` file format and must follow a [specific naming format](file-naming-format.md). Use the **Rename** function**.** You can run both **Import** and **Rename** in one go.
