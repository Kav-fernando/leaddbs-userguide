# Welcome to Lead-DBS

_Lead-DBS_ is a toolbox based in **MATLAB** that allows the user to **localize** and **visualize** in a 3D model electrodes in patients treated with **_deep brain stimulation_**.

##### Key Features
- Linear and nonlinear normalization of MRI and CT images to MNI space
- Reconstruction of the electrode trajectories when targeting the basal ganglia and the subgenual cingulate area (Brodmann area 25, or Cg25)
- Manual correction of the electrode localization
- Visualization of results in 2D slice views
- Creation of a 3D model of the electrodes in their target areas
- Calculation of the Volume of Activated Tissue (VAT) and visualization of the structural connectivity from the VAT to other brain areas
