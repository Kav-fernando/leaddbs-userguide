## Installation

_Lead-DBS_ is a toolbox that works in the [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.de/products/matlab/) programming framework ([The Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com/)).

However, there are some required steps before you can use the toolbox:

1. After downloading the folder containing _Lead-DBS_, you should set the MATLAB path to include the toolbox folder (for help on setting a path in MATLAB, go to **Section 1.1**).
2. You need _SPM8_ for normalization and file handling installed and included to your MATLAB path as well (Support for _SPM12_ is planned).
3. For good visualization options, you should download and add atlases to the _Lead-DBS_ installation directory (for more details on this step, refer to **Section 1.2**).


Once the path is set and the atlases are installed, you can run _Lead-DBS_ by entering the command `lead` into the MATLAB Command Window.
